 - basic geolocation from ip
 - vpn detection
    - based on isp???
    - location / check if geolocation is equal to a datacenter /
 - impossible travel
    - if user travelled more than ~120kms in an hour, mark as suspicious
        - magic number, 'cause only planes and trains go faster than 120
 - check for contradictions between billing address and shipping address
    - also check if current location is near to either of them
 - check for contradictions between known cellphone providers - if any
 - check for contradictions between "precise location/location services" and geolocation derived from ip
  (precise location is when a website asks for your location - it IS different from ip-based geolocation)
    - this is for stuff like mock location on android
 - if privacy doesn't matter - heat maps for locations
 - check if shipping location is considered a house - can use google's maps api for this
 - check if currently connected wifi is a possible freewifi
    - wigle.net - check if ip is on possible freenets
